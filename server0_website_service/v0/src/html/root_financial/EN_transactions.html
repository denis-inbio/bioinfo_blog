  The list of value transactions the ONG/NPO has made, just like they'd be shown in a card account monitoring service
    amount, inflow or outflow
    where
    what for
    amount available
    credit, debt

  Also, it would be nice to have here the cost of future projects that are being planned, are in the making, have been planned and devised, are in the process of / sunt in derulare, etc.
    one could come in and specifically donate for a project, so the service would have to monitor that, publish the donation and specify what for it's being allocated, etc.

  There might be a need for consultancy, you can write here who consulted you for an investment; it can also be seen as a form of advertisement (maybe reduce the cost)
