    Recover credentials: how could I do this ?
        Fill in as much info about you ? but this is intrusive
        Upload any of the past tokens ? might be useful, but it means that the past can overturn the present, and even that brute-forcing becomes easier with time, for attackers
            keep a limit of the last 3 tokens being usable; but what else should one ask for, to increase confidence ?


    ?: what can you do if your account gets stolen ? is there a way to "prove theft" ?
    ?: how to reverse the effects of an account's activity for a period of time ? for example, to remove all posts, comments, blogs, uploaded material etc., that has occurred
        in a period of time (such as when the account was stolen) - or, the initial user had ownership, but was unaware that another user was using the same account -> multi-users scenario
